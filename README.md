# **Nology Projects Repository 🚀**

Welcome to my Nology Projects Repository. This repository contains a work-in-progress collection of projects and coursework that will be developed during my time at Nology, reflecting my journey as a software engineer. Grateful to have crossed paths with Nology, because I had almost quit—why? I didn't get arrays. 😅
